            </div>
            <div class="row">
              <div class="r1">
                <h2>1. Supreme Champions League Goal-Scorer</h2>
                <p>Scoring "10" goals in a single Champions League season is a tall enough order

                  So imagine doing it in seven different campaigns. 
                  
                  During his time at Real Madrid, CR7 hit double figures in Europe’s top men’s club competition every year between the 2011/12 and 2017/18 seasons.
                  
                  The five time Ballon d’Or recipient boasts an unmatched 140 career goals in the Champions League, 11 ahead of Messi in second.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="r1">
                <h2>2. Real Madrid's Leading Scorer</h2>
                <p>Having plundered an eye watering "451" goals in just "438" games for Real Madrid in his (2009-2018) stint in the Spanish capital, Ronaldo is Los Blancos’ all time leading scorer by an absolute mile.


                  Second placed Karim Benzema registered almost "100" goals fewer "354" before leaving the club last summer.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="r1">
                <h2>3. Complete Trophy Collection with Two Clubs</h2>
                <p>There aren’t many players who have completed a clean sweep of career winners’ medals with just one club.


                  Messi won every trophy available during his illustrious spell in the Barcelona first team, but CR7 went one better, completing the full set of silverware with two clubs: "Manchester United and Real Madrid".
                  
                  
                  At both "Old Trafford and the Bernabéu", the forward lifted the league title, the domestic cup, the Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup and the Club World Cup at least once each.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="r1">
                <h2>4. Six Seasons of 50 Goals Each</h2>
                <p>As Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi get older, Erling Haaland and Kylian Mbappé are now the top young stars in soccer.

                  However, they’ll be hard pushed to break a Ronaldo scoring record that has remained out of reach of even Messi.
                  
                  For six straight years between the 2011/12 and 2015/16 campaigns
                  
                  The Portuguese scored at least "50" goals a season in all competitions for Real Madrid: 53, 60, 55, 51, 61 and 51.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="r1">
                <h2> 5. Top Scorer in International Matches</h2>
                <p>Since September 2021, Ronaldo has held the distinction of being the highest ever scorer in men’s international soccer.

                  The Al Nassr star broke the record once held by Iran's Ali Daei by scoring his 110th goal for Portugal in a World Cup qualifying match against Ireland.
                  
                  He then scored his 111th goal, helping Portugal to a thrilling, last-minute victory from behind against the Irish team,and he is still going strong.
                  
                  </p>
                  <div class="r1">
                    <h2>6.Highest goal scorer in the history of football</h2>
                    <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is the highest goal scorer in the history of football.The current number of goals he has scored in his entire life is 910 and he is still counting.The milstone of reaching 1000 goals is not far away.I dont think any player can dream of breaking the record.</p>
